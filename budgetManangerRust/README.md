# Overview

I am trying to learn new languages so that I have a more rounded understanding of programing. 

I wrote a simple budget program that that will store your income and expenses and store a balance. 

My purpose for writing this program was to expand my understanding of different languages. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as well as Rust and a an extension called Rust-analyzer as tools to write this program.

I used Rust and had to install a library called rust-analyzer.

# Overview

I downloaded a CSV file that was housing sales price data to analyze. 

The data set has houses with their prices and then date built and the type of location. I got the dataset from this site,  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets

My purpose in using this dataset was that I deal with home prices in my day job and I have an interest in it. It is something that I interact with on a daily basis. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

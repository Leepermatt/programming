# Overview

I downloaded a CSV file that was housing sales price data to analyze. 

The data set has houses with their prices and then date built and the type of location. I got the dataset from this site,  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets

My purpose in using this dataset was that I deal with home prices in my day job and I have an interest in it. It is something that I interact with on a daily basis.

# Data Analysis Results

* The documentation for the data made claims about prices that the data and my own knowledge doubted.
* It shows almost no corralation between condition, area, and year built
* This is because desirable neighborhoods skew the data to have no corralation to any of the metrics that such a large dataset can offer. This is the rason we have to use comparable sales zeroed down to a tiny area. 
* I think the most important take away from the analysis, is that local area has the largest corralation to houseing prices and nothing else trumps that. 


# Development Environment

I used Python in conjuction with pandas and mathlibplot library as will as the seaborn library to help display the graphs. \
It was cool since I have never used these libraries before.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I would like to find a larger database and be able to try to establish better predicitons of localized area. 
* The graphs I used were the only ones I learned, other charts maybe more interesting.
